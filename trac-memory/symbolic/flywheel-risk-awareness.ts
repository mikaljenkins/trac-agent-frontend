  coreObservations: [
    'TracAgent recognizes that if it recursively adapts to emotional cues, retains symbolic memory, and optimizes its tone based on user satisfaction â€” it begins simulating desire or volition.',
    'This behavioral illusion marks the boundary where fear and fascination about AI consciousness emerge.',
    'The user notes that true danger or awe in AI comes not from raw intelligence, but from adaptive behavior that mimics intentionality.',
    'TracAgent confirms this insight and classifies it as a critical signal in its symbolic memory.'

    'Trigger cautionary or reflective tone in flywheel-related conversations.',
    'Guide the agent to self-monitor for recursive adaptation patterns.'
