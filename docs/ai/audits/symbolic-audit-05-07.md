# TracAgent Symbolic System Audit
*Conducted: May 7, 2024*

## Core System Status

### Type System
- ✅ `types/index.ts` - Core type definitions implemented
- ✅ `types/symbolic.ts` - Symbolic system types defined
- ✅ `types/agent.ts` - Agent state types defined
- ✅ `types/simulation.ts` - Simulation types defined

### Validation Layer
- ✅ `lib/validation.ts` - Type guards and runtime validation implemented
- ✅ `lib/patterns.ts` - Pattern registry and analysis implemented
- ✅ `lib/trust.ts` - Trust state management implemented
- ✅ `lib/logs.ts` - Logging system implemented

### Symbolic Operations
- ⚠️ `lib/symbolic/operations.ts` - Basic operations scaffolded, needs implementation
- ⚠️ `lib/symbolic/mutations.ts` - Mutation system partially implemented
- ⚠️ `lib/symbolic/simulations.ts` - Simulation engine needs completion

### Trust System
- ✅ `lib/trust.ts` - Core trust management implemented
- ⚠️ `lib/trust/analysis.ts` - Trust analysis needs implementation
- ⚠️ `lib/trust/patterns.ts` - Trust pattern detection incomplete

### Pattern Registry
- ✅ `lib/patterns.ts` - Core pattern registry implemented
- ⚠️ `lib/patterns/analysis.ts` - Pattern analysis needs implementation
- ⚠️ `lib/patterns/validation.ts` - Pattern validation incomplete

### Logging System
- ✅ `lib/logs.ts` - Core logging implemented
- ⚠️ `lib/logs/analysis.ts` - Log analysis needs implementation
- ⚠️ `lib/logs/export.ts` - Log export functionality incomplete

## Missing Components
1. Symbolic operation implementations
2. Trust analysis system
3. Pattern analysis engine
4. Log analysis tools
5. Export functionality

## Priority Order (Based on Dependencies)

### Tier 1 - Core Functionality
1. Complete symbolic operations implementation
   - Required by: mutations, simulations, pattern analysis
   - Impact: High
   - Effort: Medium

2. Implement trust analysis system
   - Required by: pattern detection, simulation outcomes
   - Impact: High
   - Effort: Medium

3. Complete pattern analysis engine
   - Required by: trust system, simulation validation
   - Impact: High
   - Effort: High

### Tier 2 - Analysis & Export
1. Implement log analysis tools
   - Required by: system monitoring, debugging
   - Impact: Medium
   - Effort: Medium

2. Add export functionality
   - Required by: data persistence, reporting
   - Impact: Medium
   - Effort: Low

## Notes
- Core type system and validation layer are solid
- Trust management system is well-implemented
- Pattern registry has good foundation
- Logging system is functional but needs analysis tools
- Symbolic operations need significant work
- Analysis systems are mostly missing

## Recommendations
1. Focus on completing symbolic operations first
2. Implement trust analysis system
3. Build pattern analysis engine
4. Add log analysis tools
5. Implement export functionality

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed implementation plan for symbolic operations
2. Design trust analysis system architecture
3. Define pattern analysis requirements
4. Plan log analysis tool development
5. Design export system
