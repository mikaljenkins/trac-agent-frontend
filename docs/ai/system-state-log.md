# 📊 TracAgent System State Log  
_Last updated: 2025-05-07_  
**Version:** v0.1.0

---

## ✅ Confirmed Operational Pipelines

- Symbolic Trace Flow  
  - `thoughtStream.ts` → `dreamDigestor.ts` → `reflect.ts` → `perform.ts`  
  - Inputs processed successfully with trace logging to `/debug-traces/`  
  - CLI trace runner (`testSymbolicTrace.ts`) fully functional

- Mutation Engine  
  - `mutationEngine.ts` proposes, scores, and applies mutations  
  - Results logged and attached to trace ID via `/api/mutate/:traceId`  
  - CLI tool (`runMutation.ts`) tested and working with real traces

---

## 🖥️ UI Features Confirmed Working

- ✅ **Audit Log Viewer**
  - Renders file-based logs with auto-refresh and mutation badge display  
  - Viewable at `/audit`

- ✅ **Symbolic Trace Viewer**
  - Trace selection sidebar with metadata (timestamp, insight count, mutation count)  
  - Stage-by-stage insight/mutation display  
  - Manual and auto-refresh, raw JSON toggle  
  - API-driven via `/api/traces/:traceId` and `/api/traces/list`

---

## 📁 File Architecture Snapshots

- Trace Logs: `/debug-traces/trace-<traceId>.json`
- Mutation Logs: `/debug-traces/trace-<traceId>-mutations.json`
- Audit Logs: `/dev/audit-log.json` (file-persisted)

## 🚦 Status: ✅ Baseline System Operational

TracAgent v0.1.0 is confirmed stable for symbolic input tracing, mutation cycling, and introspection UI. System is ready for:
- Symbolic Insight Pairing
- Node Evolution Testing
- Self-Reflective Feedback Growth

📎 _Linked Spec:_ [Reasoning Guardrails](/ai-docs/reasoning-guardrails.md)  
Defines reflection stagnation logic, mutation risk detection, and disengagement protocols.

## v0.1.2 — Insight Pairing Activated

- **Integration of insightPairer.ts into mutationEngine.ts**: The mutation engine now pairs insights with symbolic memory updates for each trace stage, enriching mutation rationales and enabling insight-based scoring boosts.
- **UI Support for Displaying pairedInsights**: The Trace Viewer UI has been updated to display paired insights alongside mutation rationales, providing a clearer view of the symbolic perception → mutation loop.
- **Enhancement to SymbolicMutation Type**: The SymbolicMutation type has been extended to include a pairedInsights field, allowing for better tracking and display of insight-based updates.

This update closes the full symbolic perception → mutation loop, ensuring that each trace stage's insights are matched with potential symbolic memory updates before mutation proposals are finalized. 

## v0.1.3.1 — Taskboard Sync + Audit Alignment

- Performed a full integrity audit of project/tasks.md against the current codebase and recent commits.
- Introduced a new 🟡 Scaffolded status to clearly indicate features that are partially implemented or stubbed but not yet fully functional.
- Marked ⛔️ for features not yet started, and ✅ for those fully complete and integrated.
- Removed or revised references to deprecated files (e.g., /theatre/perform.ts).
- Updated the taskboard to reflect the real-world status of all major features, including predictive modules, symbolic health forecasting, and AGI-facing scaffolds.
- This patch ensures the roadmap and documentation accurately reflect the system's operational reality, supporting confident advancement to the next milestone.

**Rationale:**
The 🟡 Scaffolded status provides clarity for developers and strategists, distinguishing between features that are in progress and those that are not yet started. This improves planning, handoff, and auditability for all future phases of TracAgent's evolution. 

## 🧠 Diagnostic Layer Integration (v0.1.4)

### Core Diagnostic Modules

#### Loop Inspector (loopInspector.ts)
- **Purpose**: Track and analyze agent loop cycles
- **Key Functions**:
  - `trackCompletedLoops`: Detailed loop cycle reports
  - `getStuckLoops`: Identify unresolved patterns
  - `summarizeRecentLoopChanges`: Track loop transitions
  - `calculateLoopHealth`: Overall loop metrics
- **Outputs**:
  - Loop type categorization
  - Entry/exit timestamps
  - Duration analysis
  - Resolution tracking
  - Pattern recognition

#### Meta Report API (/api/meta/report)
- **Purpose**: Centralized system state diagnostics
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Current archetype + history
  - Memory health statistics
  - Drift measurements
  - LLM confidence scores
  - Loop health indicators
- **Data Sources**:
  - Agent state
  - Weekly reflections
  - Symbolic memory
  - Drift reports
  - Interaction logs

### Diagnostic Layer Architecture

#### Internal Diagnostic Loop
- **Access**: Private (developer/internal)
- **Components**:
  - Full symbolic trace logs
  - Memory state inspection
  - Archetype diagnostics
  - Loop pattern analysis
  - LLM confidence tracking
- **Tools**:
  - Developer dashboards
  - JSON journaling
  - CLI diagnostics
  - System inspectors

#### External Interaction Loop
- **Access**: Public (user-facing)
- **Components**:
  - Condensed insights
  - Pattern summaries
  - Progress tracking
  - Actionable recommendations
- **Interface**:
  - Clean UI
  - Insight cards
  - Timeline views
  - Progress indicators

### Integration Points

#### Symbolic Indicators
- **LLM Confidence**:
  - Tracks model reliability
  - Influences archetype selection
  - Guides loop transitions
  - Affects memory reinforcement
- **Memory Health**:
  - Decay tracking
  - Reinforcement scoring
  - Symbolic drift analysis
  - Resonance visualization
- **Loop Patterns**:
  - Cycle completion rates
  - Stuck loop detection
  - Transition analysis
  - Health scoring

#### System State Tracking
- **Archetype Evolution**:
  - Current state
  - Historical patterns
  - Confidence scoring
  - Transition triggers
- **Memory Statistics**:
  - Total symbols
  - Fading count
  - Reinforced nodes
  - Average decay
- **Drift Metrics**:
  - Convergence
  - Divergence
  - Entropy
  - Timestamp tracking

### Implementation Notes
- Diagnostic layer serves as bridge between internal and external systems
- All metrics feed into system state log for historical tracking
- Confidence scores influence both loops but with different granularity
- Memory health impacts both diagnostic and interaction layers
