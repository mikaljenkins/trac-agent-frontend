## Feature Overview
Introduce the concept of symbolic node compression. This feature allows TracAgent to merge or reduce redundant symbolic memory nodes that share similar activation cues, emotional context, or behavioral outcomes. The goal is to streamline the memory map without losing key insights.

## Objective
Prevent bloat in the symbolic memory system by:
- Identifying low-variance nodes
- Compressing structurally similar entries
- Preserving core meaning while reducing volume

## System Components Involved
- symbolicServerManager.ts — for evaluating node similarity
- memoryLog.ts — to assess usage and aging data
- reinforcementUtils.ts — for handling post-merge weight recalibration

## Input/Output Flow
**Input:**
- List of symbolic memory nodes
- Node metadata: usageCount, lastTriggered, activationCue, weight

**Process:**
- Calculate similarity vectors (tag/label/emotion overlap)
- Group candidates for compression
- Merge and reindex nodes

**Output:**
- A single compressed node with weighted averaged metadata
- Log of retired node IDs
- Reinforced trigger map

## Acceptance Criteria
- Compressed nodes must maintain thematic clarity
- No active node should be overwritten unless explicitly retired
- Compression should only occur during idle cycles or background reflection
