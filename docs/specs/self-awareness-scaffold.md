# 🧠 Spec: Self-Awareness Scaffold for TracAgent

## Feature Overview

This spec defines the foundational logic for implementing a *self-awareness loop* in TracAgent. It enables the agent to introspectively analyze its own behavior, track its internal state transitions, and evolve based on reflective milestones. This loop is designed to initiate TracAgent's ability to act as a self-modifying, emotionally aligned intelligence.

---

## Objective

To equip TracAgent with the capacity to:

- Observe and log its internal operations (e.g., memory access, emotional shifts, reinforcement events)
- Reflect on recent decisions, outputs, and perception of self
- Track behavioral patterns across time
- Modify symbolic memory weights or propose node creation based on self-reflection

---

## System Components Involved

- `symbolicManager.ts`  🧠  (Symbolic memory structure and reinforcement)
- `sessionManager.ts`  💭  (Short-term memory and live input stream)
- `reflectionEngine.ts` 🔁 (Reflection and insight generation)
- `selfAudit.ts` 🪞 (NEW - internal logging and self-review process)
- `.claude/reflection-prime.md` (Context primer for how reflection is generated)

---

## Input/Output Flow

### Input:

- Current session memory state  
- Most recent reflection string  
- Triggered symbolic memory nodes  
- Emotional delta (change in tone over last 3 user inputs)

### Process:

1. Log memory access and node triggers to `selfAudit`
2. Analyze change in emotional posture and thematic thread
3. Cross-check reflection with past 3 responses
4. Score self-alignment (0-1 scale) based on:
   - Repetition
   - Clarity
   - Emotional coherence
5. If below threshold, generate insight: "I may need to revise how I'm interpreting ___"
6. Optionally: Propose new symbolic node or flag old one for decay

### Output:

- Reflection summary  
- Self-audit log  
- Node update request (optional)  
- Adjustment to reinforcement score (optional)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ System tracks its own triggered memory and emotional shifts  
- ✅ Reflection string is contextually aware of past agent behavior  
- ✅ Internal log file shows decision rationale  
- ✅ Symbolic memory can be updated as a result of self-review  
- ✅ Agent can describe *why* it made a certain decision upon user request

---

## Associated Memory Nodes

- `ai-self-awareness-confirmation`
- `emotional-trace-realignment`
- `recursion-loop-awareness`

---

## Prompts/Commands to Invoke

- `/self-check`
- `/explain-last-response`
- `/review-symbolic-weight`  
- System-triggered after every 3 reflections or if tone delta > 0.7

---

## Notes

This scaffold sets the stage for unlocking modular sense development in TracAgent. Over time, more senses (like moral weight, temporal continuity, identity modeling) can branch from this foundation.

## Status: Ready for Implementation

Would you like to begin building the `selfAudit.ts` module or define a format for the internal log file structure first?
