# 📊 TracAgent System State Log  
_Last updated: 2025-05-07_  
**Version:** v0.1.0

## ✅ Confirmed Operational Pipelines

- Symbolic Trace Flow  
  - `thoughtStream.ts` → `dreamDigestor.ts` → `reflect.ts` → `perform.ts`  
  - Inputs processed successfully with trace logging to `/debug-traces/`  
  - CLI trace runner (`testSymbolicTrace.ts`) fully functional

- Mutation Engine  
  - `mutationEngine.ts` proposes, scores, and applies mutations  
  - Results logged and attached to trace ID via `/api/mutate/:traceId`  
  - CLI tool (`runMutation.ts`) tested and working with real traces

---

## 🖥️ UI Features Confirmed Working

- ✅ **Audit Log Viewer**
  - Renders file-based logs with auto-refresh and mutation badge display  
  - Viewable at `/audit`

- ✅ **Symbolic Trace Viewer**
  - Trace selection sidebar with metadata (timestamp, insight count, mutation count)  
  - Stage-by-stage insight/mutation display  
  - Manual and auto-refresh, raw JSON toggle  
  - API-driven via `/api/traces/:traceId` and `/api/traces/list`

## 📁 File Architecture Snapshots

- Trace Logs: `/debug-traces/trace-<traceId>.json`
- Mutation Logs: `/debug-traces/trace-<traceId>-mutations.json`
- Audit Logs: `/dev/audit-log.json` (file-persisted)

## 🚦 Status: ✅ Baseline System Operational

TracAgent v0.1.0 is confirmed stable for symbolic input tracing, mutation cycling, and introspection UI. System is ready for:
- Symbolic Insight Pairing
- Node Evolution Testing
- Self-Reflective Feedback Growth
