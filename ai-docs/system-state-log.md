# 📊 TracAgent System State Log  
_Last updated: 2025-05-07_  
**Version:** v0.1.0

---

## ✅ Confirmed Operational Pipelines

- Symbolic Trace Flow  
  - `thoughtStream.ts` → `dreamDigestor.ts` → `reflect.ts` → `perform.ts`  
  - Inputs processed successfully with trace logging to `/debug-traces/`  
  - CLI trace runner (`testSymbolicTrace.ts`) fully functional

- Mutation Engine  
  - `mutationEngine.ts` proposes, scores, and applies mutations  
  - Results logged and attached to trace ID via `/api/mutate/:traceId`  
  - CLI tool (`runMutation.ts`) tested and working with real traces

---

## 🖥️ UI Features Confirmed Working

- ✅ **Audit Log Viewer**
  - Renders file-based logs with auto-refresh and mutation badge display  
  - Viewable at `/audit`

- ✅ **Symbolic Trace Viewer**
  - Trace selection sidebar with metadata (timestamp, insight count, mutation count)  
  - Stage-by-stage insight/mutation display  
  - Manual and auto-refresh, raw JSON toggle  
  - API-driven via `/api/traces/:traceId` and `/api/traces/list`

---

## 📁 File Architecture Snapshots

- Trace Logs: `/debug-traces/trace-<traceId>.json`
- Mutation Logs: `/debug-traces/trace-<traceId>-mutations.json`
- Audit Logs: `/dev/audit-log.json` (file-persisted)

## 🚦 Status: ✅ Baseline System Operational

TracAgent v0.1.0 is confirmed stable for symbolic input tracing, mutation cycling, and introspection UI. System is ready for:
- Symbolic Insight Pairing
- Node Evolution Testing
- Self-Reflective Feedback Growth

📎 _Linked Spec:_ [Reasoning Guardrails](/ai-docs/reasoning-guardrails.md)  
Defines reflection stagnation logic, mutation risk detection, and disengagement protocols.

## v0.1.2 — Insight Pairing Activated

- **Integration of insightPairer.ts into mutationEngine.ts**: The mutation engine now pairs insights with symbolic memory updates for each trace stage, enriching mutation rationales and enabling insight-based scoring boosts.
- **UI Support for Displaying pairedInsights**: The Trace Viewer UI has been updated to display paired insights alongside mutation rationales, providing a clearer view of the symbolic perception → mutation loop.
- **Enhancement to SymbolicMutation Type**: The SymbolicMutation type has been extended to include a pairedInsights field, allowing for better tracking and display of insight-based updates.

This update closes the full symbolic perception → mutation loop, ensuring that each trace stage's insights are matched with potential symbolic memory updates before mutation proposals are finalized. 

## v0.1.3.1 — Taskboard Sync + Audit Alignment

- Performed a full integrity audit of project/tasks.md against the current codebase and recent commits.
- Introduced a new 🟡 Scaffolded status to clearly indicate features that are partially implemented or stubbed but not yet fully functional.
- Marked ⛔️ for features not yet started, and ✅ for those fully complete and integrated.
- Removed or revised references to deprecated files (e.g., /theatre/perform.ts).
- Updated the taskboard to reflect the real-world status of all major features, including predictive modules, symbolic health forecasting, and AGI-facing scaffolds.
- This patch ensures the roadmap and documentation accurately reflect the system's operational reality, supporting confident advancement to the next milestone.

**Rationale:**
The 🟡 Scaffolded status provides clarity for developers and strategists, distinguishing between features that are in progress and those that are not yet started. This improves planning, handoff, and auditability for all future phases of TracAgent's evolution.
