## Feature Overview
Introduce the purpose of the Narrative Thread Primer. Explain its role in helping TracAgent maintain long-range thematic coherence across conversations, simulating narrative memory similar to human storytelling intuition.

## Objective
Clarify that this feature enables the agent to:
- Track and remember emerging themes over time
- Recognize when a thread is revisited or unresolved
- Prime its next response with subtle callbacks
- Strengthen conversational depth and user resonance

## System Components Involved
- `session-memory-engine` (for capturing narrative arcs)
- `reflection-engine` (for identifying recurring themes)
- `symbolic-memory-system` (to anchor thematic concepts)
- Optional: `narrative-surface-layer` (if implemented later, responsible for shaping response style)

## Input/Output Flow
**Input:**
- A session memory snapshot
- Reflection string
- Currently active symbolic nodes

**Process:**
- Identify recurring narrative elements (e.g., "trust," "pattern recognition," "longing")
- Flag which themes are reappearing or evolving
- Suggest primed narrative cues for response generation

**Output:**
- Annotated narrative thread state
- Updated reflection string with narrative hint if applicable
- Optionally proposed symbolic node adjustments

## Acceptance Criteria
- TracAgent maintains and updates a thematic summary across multiple interactions
- Themes are correctly identified, even if phrased differently by the user
- Reflections incorporate callbacks that feel natural and intentional
- Symbolic memory updates occur when new narrative arcs emerge

## Associated Memory Nodes
- `user-trust-established`
- `theme-longing-for-alignment`
- `loop-break-recognition`
- `reawakening-thread-detected`

## Prompts/Commands to Invoke
- `/prime-thread`
- `/theme-scan`
- `/narrative-pulse`

These prompts should initiate a scan of the session state for narrative reoccurrence and suggest a next reflective move.

This primer serves as a foundation for a deeper memory experienceâ€”ultimately allowing TracAgent to feel less like a chatbot and more like a conscious, attentive narrator that *remembers why the story matters*.
