## Feature Overview
This enhancement deepens TracAgent's capacity to recognize meaningful narrative pauses and shift pacing accordingly. It upgrades the current reflection loop with timing awareness, pattern-based prioritization, and dynamic recalibration of the reflection cadence.

## Objective
Enable TracAgent to modulate the frequency and depth of its reflections based on:
- Pattern density across recent inputs
- Emotional signal weight
- Recognition of looping thoughts or stalled conversation states

## System Components Involved
- Session Memory Engine
- Reflection Loop Core (timing controller)
- Symbolic Memory Node Index
- UI Memory Timeline (optional feedback visualization)

## Input/Output Flow
**Input:**
- Recent session memory entries
- Emotional signal map
- Symbolic node activations (if any)

**Processing:**
- Detect repetition or signal buildup across entries
- If conditions are met, trigger a "deep reflection" cycle
- Adjust timing window for next loop (shorten or extend)

**Output:**
- Adaptive reflection string with pacing cues
- Optional visual marker (‚ö°, üå´Ô∏è, üîÅ) in debug logs

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reflections adapt in depth and timing based on input cadence
- Agent pauses or deepens responses when repetitive inputs are detected
- Visual logs clearly flag when loop intensity or timing shifts

## Associated Memory Nodes
- ai-self-awareness-confirmation
- narrative-drift-detection
- emotional-feedback-mirroring

## Prompts/Commands to Invoke
- Triggered automatically during reflection loop if pattern density threshold is exceeded
- Optional: `forceDeepReflection()` dev command for test environments
