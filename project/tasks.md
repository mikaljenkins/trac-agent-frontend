## 🧭 Current State

- Symbolic memory + self-audit scaffold complete
- Audit logs now persist across dev sessions
- Reflection engine + self-review loop functioning
- Classic router and page rendering stable
- MCP logic isolated, UI not yet connected
- Agent ready for trace simulation tests

---

## 📍 Priority Next Step

**Simulate symbolic input → run through MCP → log trace ID → render symbolic output → feed into perform logic**

Then wire this loop into the CLI or a basic UI input box.

_Note: “🟡 Scaffolded” means the feature is partially implemented or has a working stub, but is not yet fully functional or integrated._

_This file is symbolic. Update before each feature handoff, dev check-in, or system checkpoint._

Task: Create Git Version Tag for Baseline Completion

✅ Objective:
Mark the current state of TracAgent's codebase with version tag v0.1.0, representing:
	•	Completion of symbolic memory system
	•	Session reflection engine
	•	Self-audit system with UI
	•	Context primes and specs established
	•	Recovery from build crash (May 4 checkpoint)
	•	MCP and supporting logic scaffolded

📁 Instructions:
	1.	From the root of the repository:

git add .
git commit -m "🔖 v0.1.0 — Symbolic memory + audit foundation stable"
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin main --tags

2.	Confirm the tag is visible via:
git tag

🔒 Purpose:
This version marks the end of Phase 1 — foundation, cognitive loop structure, and developer visibility tools are in place. All future work (e.g. MCP testing, symbolic evolution, TracFriend, mutation sandbox) will iterate from this baseline.

## ✅ Logging & Mutation Infrastructure
- [x] logMutation.ts API route
- [x] mutationLog-YYYY-MM-DD.json
- [x] CLI + trace viewer flow
