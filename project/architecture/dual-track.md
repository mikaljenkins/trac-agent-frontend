# 🧭 TracAgent Dual-Track Architecture (v0.1.4)

🔗 Canonical diagnostic details now live in ai-docs/system-state-log.md (v0.1.4 and beyond)

## Purpose
To maintain long-term alignment between TracAgent's private diagnostic intelligence and future public-facing products through a dual-track system architecture.

## 🔐 Track 1: Internal Diagnostic Intelligence (Private)

### Audience
- Core developer team
- Symbolic engineers
- Internal operators

### Functionality
- Full symbolic loop breakdowns
  - Trace logs
  - Drift analysis
  - Memory state inspection
- Archetype diagnostics
  - Activation patterns
  - Reasoning chains
  - Confidence scoring
- Memory system monitoring
  - Health metrics
  - Pruning status
  - Reinforcement impact
- Reflection synthesis
  - Weekly summaries
  - Mutation history
  - Pattern evolution
- Visualization tools
  - Resonance trends
  - Entropy decay
  - Loop health metrics
- LLM monitoring
  - Invocation logs
  - Reinforcement tracking
  - Confidence scoring

### Interface
- Developer dashboards
- JSON journaling layers
- CLI diagnostic tools
- Reflection triggers
- System state inspectors

## 💬 Track 2: Public Interaction Layer (User-Facing)

### Audience
- Future users
- Clients
- General operators

### Functionality
- Natural language interaction
  - Chat interface
  - Command processing
  - Response generation
- Abstracted insights
  - Symbolic reflections
  - Pattern recognition
  - Trend analysis
- Condensed outputs
  - Key takeaways
  - Actionable insights
  - Progress tracking
- Optional features
  - Alignment recommendations
  - Custom visualizations
  - Export capabilities

### Interface
- Clean, minimalist UI
- Agent chat window
- Insight cards
- Optional timeline view
- Progress indicators

## 🔄 Principle of Separation

### Core Principles
1. Internal tools evolve with full symbolic fidelity
2. Public layer exposes only distilled outputs
3. System complexity remains protected
4. All internal states are tracked but optionally obfuscated

### Benefits
- Improved reasoning depth without overwhelming users
- Clean separation of debugging and user interface
- Scalable architecture for future agent development
- Protected core intelligence system

## ✅ Implementation Guidelines

### Development Priorities
1. Symbolic insight UI and memory systems for internal use
2. Public-facing interaction layer as a subscription service
3. Dual-mode architecture for all new components
4. Clear separation of concerns between tracks

### Technical Requirements
- Secure internal diagnostic access
- Clean public API boundaries
- Scalable monitoring systems
- Efficient data flow between tracks

## 📝 Version History
- v0.1.4: Initial dual-track architecture definition
- Future: Track-specific feature development
